# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
####
	The CEO of PyBer requested that raw data from two CSV files pertaining to rural, suburban, and urban regions be summarized with the use of charts. Shortly after the presentation of this data using Python and Pandas, the CEO requested a new analysis to be performed based solely on the ride-sharing data by city type. This new request focused heavily on tables to summarize the data in a readable format. A single line plot was also created to best display the weekly totals of fares by city type using Python, matplotlib, and Pandas.

general description of results: urban clearly makes most money and most rides. rural pretty costly per fare due to smaller population.
